}
\arguments{
\item{screen_width}{Resolution width of the screen on which the experiment is conducted (in pixels). E.g. 1920}

\item{screen_height}{Resolution height of the screen on which the experiment is conducted (in pixels). E.g. 1080}

\item{top_left_x}{x coordinate of the top left pixel of the browser viewing area}

\item{top_left_y}{y coordinate of the same pixel}

\item{bottom_right_x}{x coordinate of the bottom right pixel of the browser viewing area}

\item{bottom_right_y}{y coordinate of the same pixel}

\item{scroll_pixels}{The amount of pixels being scrolled by each mouse scroll
(depends on the browser)}
}
\value{
A list representing the calibration to the screen & browser used for the experiment
}
\description{
Creates a calibration list for use in the eye_tracker_fixation_scroll
    function. Can be filled in by taking measurements by hand, or using the
    calibration tool.
