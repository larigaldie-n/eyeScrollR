# eyeScrollR
An R package to correctly place eye-tracking fixation data on areas of scrollable websites, and simplify the creation of heatmaps on longer-than-screen images.

# ToDo list
- Tests for new functions
- Rename everything "anchor" to "fixed_area"
- Documentation for the fixed areas
- Make sure the scroll is within the area
